# stcath-calendar
All comittee meetings stored as an iCal file.

This file is made available as part of St. Catharines Open Data. The city doesn't have an official Open Data program yet, but citizens are free to work with existing, available public data and turn it into shareable formats. We're doing this:

* To show that the work is simple.
* To show the value in citizen-led work.
* To show areas in which short-term value can be found.

##Why?
Looking for event and meeting information in the city is complicated. There's multiple approaches. Exported data doesn't work as expected. There's no unified view on anything. The following activities are currently very difficult.

* Ensuring one meeting doesn't conflict with another.
* Allowing a citizen to see what meetings are taking place 2-3 months in the future.
* Seeing which meetings might be more valuable if we moved meeting dates, times, or locations so that other members could participate.

## Installation
* Download the zip file.
* Extract zip
* Import into your calendar application of choice.
